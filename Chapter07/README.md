# Chapter07

Chapter07 is set up to work with yarn workspaces as well as regular npm installs.

Yarn Workspaces save time on install and disk space by sharing dependencies between all the examples, exercises and Activities.

In order to use workspaces:
1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
2. Install dependencies from this folder using `yarn`

To install without Yarn, change your active directory to the example, exercise or activity you wish to run and run `npm install`.
